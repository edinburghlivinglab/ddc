# 1. Introduction
Provide a brief overview of your report, explain the specific problem you are addressing, and why you think it is important.

# 2. Describing Your Problem Area
Explain in more detail what your problem is and how it involves different groups of stakeholders. Describe what stakeholders you engaged with during your project, why you chose them and what you learned about the needs and values of the relevant stakeholder groups. You do not need to give an exhaustive description of all the information you collected about the stakeholders. 

# 3. Your Design Idea
Describe the primary design idea that you developed. Justify **why** you developed this particular idea from among the range of options that you considered, and relate it to the problem area described in the previous section. What evidence do you have for the feasibility of this idea? Use appropriate techniques (e.g., tables, graphs, diagrams, photos) for communicating the information that supports your idea and for illustrating the idea itself, especially if the idea is primarily visual.  Data that provides evidence for your idea may include verbatim quotations or dialogues from focus groups and PD sessions. 
NB You can draw on any research or design exercises carried out within your team, not just information that you collected by yourself.

# 4. Evaluation and Next Steps
What do you think needs to be done next in order to further develop your team's primary idea?  What additional evidence would you like to collect or what further user testing? Are there other design ideas from your project that you have not explored as fully as you wish, and that you think merit more attention? Are there other stakeholders or key individuals in the University who would have to be influenced in order to fully realise the potential of your idea? 

# 5. Reflections
How have you dealt with challenges of engaging with people in the University community? What has been your experience of working within an interdisciplinary team and sharing out work, responsibilities and roles? What was your personal contribution to the team effort during the project, both in terms of your expertise and knowledge, and also in terms of the tasks you carried out?

# 6. Conclusions
Summarise overall what you personally, and your team, have accomplished in
your project. This part of your report should draw together the main threads
of your report.
