**Data, Design and Society** is a new sort of course that combines
interdisciplinary teamwork with practice-based challenges. It is a
collaboration between the School of Informatics, Social and Political
Studies, and Design Informatics.

In today’s economy, students need the skills to work together with
people across different disciplines, and are likely to be confronted
by multi-dimensional challenges with complex social, legal, political
and technological dimensions. This *learning-by-developing* course
will introduce you to ways of combining modern tools for data analysis
with design-based approaches. It will encourage you to develop
innovative ideas and communicate them effectively in different social
arenas.

In the **Data** strand of the course, you will learn to collect,
assess and present data as social and scientific evidence, and to use
it as a resource for design. The **Design** element asks you to
challenge existing practices by creating prototype social
interventions. The **Society** strand introduces the ‘social life
of data’ and shows how data and design can be used to shape society
for the better within the framework of existing social and political
processes. The course will give you the opportunity to take your
learning out of the classroom into the University community.

**Data, Design and Society**
([INFR08024](https://path.is.ed.ac.uk/courses/INFR08024_SV1_SEM2)) is
a 20pt Level 8 course. There are no prerequisites, but you should
be prepared to ask lots of questions, to go out and talk to people, 
to work with simple data analysis tools, and to experiment with change.
