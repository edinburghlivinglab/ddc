## The Smart Campus

The **theme** of the course this year is on Edinburgh University as a 'Smart Campus' = as a key institution in the city, with thousands of staff, students,and a huge estate, how can we use data generated by university operations and student activities to develop interventions to meet some live challanges: The student experience, the caring university, and reaching zero carbon. 

## The University in the City 

You will be working with the University in the City as your focus, research area and canvas for intervention. The University is one of the most important institutions in Edinburgh, the biggest emplyer, with the largest estate of buildings, and is a leading innovator in carbin reduction.  It hosts students from all over the world, of many ages and backgrounds, cades the challenge modernising the student experience and its relationship to students, and the staff, while maintaining and caring for centuries old traditions.  Your challenge is to gather and use data from the campus and its staff and student, and propose and test  ideas and prototypes that could effectively change the University for the better, taking  in to account the multiple agendas and values of the university management and community, and the resources available


In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, you have the opportunity to work with a number of university organisions that will help you focus your research and design around their area of work.

Your project work will be divided into five phases over the course of the
semester. Descriptions of the phases can be found by following the links

## Design and Design Methods

The core of a DDC project is closely related to how we think about design.
Here, design is about the processes of identifying and solving problems, often
with input from other people affected by those problems, and often by trial
and error. We adopt the [broad definition of design by Herbert Simon](https://
en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon#The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial.2C_1969), namely 
"devising courses of action aimed at changing existing situations
into preferred ones".

**Design methods** are a form of exploring the world, often via trial and
error: considering options&mdash;even options that sound strange,
uncomfortable or impossible&mdash;and then developing "interventions" as
experiments to see how we can change the current situation. In DDS, we will
use [participatory
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design); this is a design
process which aims at involving all stakeholders (e.g., residents, firms, businesses, students, policy officers) in defining problems, helping focus on solutions, and
evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.

Design, as a discipline and a collection of processes, has no requirement to
use technology. There is also no requirement to build physical or digital
artifacts. Design may be mostly about ideas, and imagining how something could
potentially work very differently than it does now. Many designs may involve
technology, or make physical objects, but only where this seems appropriate
for the problem at hand. You may be designing a "service", an awareness raising 
campaign, and policy proposal or a data collection programme.

## Data

Data plays an important role in our approach to design. First, we need to
**understand** "the existing situation", and we use data as an essential tool
to reach this understanding. Second,  in order to **evaluate** the
effectiveness of an intervention, we need to collect data that will helps us measure this.
Data includes information that tells us about organisations, things, places, people, processes and practices and their relationships.

[What is Data?](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/what_is_data.ipynb) 
gives a quick overview of different kinds of data that we will use in the
course. One important distinction is between subjective and objective
data. Although it's hard to give a completely watertight definition,
subjective data will involve people's thoughts, emotions and values, while
objective data is based on observations of physical phenomena. The collection of both tyes of data 
requires tested 'instruments' - questionnaires, participant samples, technical devices, group discussions,
administrative record keeping methods, outputs of models etc, and using this to create evidence for design, knowledge, 
building relationships, or promoting an idea or course of action.

### <a name="two_kinds_of_data"></a>Two kinds of data {#two_kinds_of_data}

As part of your
DDS project, you are required to use both **subjective** and **objective** data. In
addition, you are required to use some **existing** data and also to
**collect** some new data. So your project should involve at least one of the data scenarios shown in these diagrams:
