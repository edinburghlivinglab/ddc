## Reuse, Upcycling and the Circular Economy in Edinburgh

The **theme** of the course this year is Reuse, Recycling and the Circular Economy in Edinburgh &mdash; how can we make the production, consumption and disposal of materials within the the city  more sustainable?

> "A circular economy is one where systems are designed
to make better use of valuable products and materials -
changing the way they are produced and managed to have
less impact on finite natural resources, and create greater
economic benefit.
The ultimate goal of a circular economy is to keep products
and materials circulating in a high-value state of use for as
long as possible and maximise resources.
This is achieved by designing products smartly with their
whole life cycle in mind, re-using and repairing to extend
their useful life, and then when their life is deemed over,
remanufacturing to create new products from old" (<a href="https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk">Zero Waste Scotland</a>)

The Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce, the City of Edinburgh Council, the University and many other organistions in the city are currently attempting to develop strategies and and processes for that fullfil the circular economy goals. You can read a recent report on opportunities in the city supported by a national organistion Zero Waste Scotland.

In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, you have the opportunity to work with a number of city and university organisions that will help you focus your research and design around their area of work.

Your project work will be divided into five phases over the course of the
semester. Descriptions of the phases can be found by following the links

## Design and Design Methods

The core of a DDC project is closely related to how we think about design.
Here, design is about the processes of identifying and solving problems, often
with input from other people affected by those problems, and often by trial
and error. We adopt the [broad definition of design by Herbert Simon](https://
en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon#The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial.2C_1969), namely 
"devising courses of action aimed at changing existing situations
into preferred ones".

**Design methods** are a form of exploring the world, often via trial and
error: considering options&mdash;even options that sound strange,
uncomfortable or impossible&mdash;and then developing "interventions" as
experiments to see how we can change the current situation. In DDS, we will
use [participatory
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design); this is a design
process which aims at involving all stakeholders (e.g., residents, firms, businesses, students, policy officers) in defining problems, helping focus on solutions, and
evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.

Design, as a discipline and a collection of processes, has no requirement to
use technology. There is also no requirement to build physical or digital
artifacts. Design may be mostly about ideas, and imagining how something could
potentially work very differently than it does now. Many designs may involve
technology, or make physical objects, but only where this seems appropriate
for the problem at hand. You may be designing a "service", an awareness raising 
campaign, and policy proposal or a data collection programme.

## Data

Data plays an important role in our approach to design. First, we need to
**understand** "the existing situation", and we use data as an essential tool
to reach this understanding. Second,  in order to **evaluate** the
effectiveness of an intervention, we need to collect data that will helps us measure this.
Data includes information that tells us about organisations, things, places, people, processes and practices and their relationships.

[What is Data?](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/what_is_data.ipynb) 
gives a quick overview of different kinds of data that we will use in the
course. One important distinction is between subjective and objective
data. Although it's hard to give a completely watertight definition,
subjective data will involve people's thoughts, emotions and values, while
objective data is based on observations of physical phenomena. The collection of both tyes of data 
requires tested 'instruments' - questionnaires, participant samples, technical devices, group discussions,
administrative record keeping methods, outputs of models etc, and using this to create evidence for design, knowledge, 
building relationships, or promoting an idea or course of action.

### <a name="two_kinds_of_data"></a>Two kinds of data {#two_kinds_of_data}

As part of your
DDS project, you are required to use both **subjective** and **objective** data. In
addition, you are required to use some **existing** data and also to
**collect** some new data. So your project should involve at least one of the data scenarios shown in these diagrams:

## The City &mdash; Edinburgh

You will be working with the City of Edinburgh as your focus, research area and canvas for intervention. Why the City? Cities, small and large, are where most of the world's population live, and where there is the most intensive production and consumption of goods and services. We can think of it an an ecosystem that is natural, designed, economic, technological, and social. Each city has its own history, culture and geography that shaped its present and will continue to shape its future. You will be exploring the forces that have shaped how the city of Edinburgh works, focusing on production consumption and waste, and the organisations trying to change thing, and resisting change.You will learn about the laws and institutions that govern the city, where its wealth comes from and how it is distributed, the routines and expectations of its population, and the barriers to change.
