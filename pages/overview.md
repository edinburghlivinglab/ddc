## Food and Sustainability in the University

The **theme** of the course this year is Food and Sustainability &mdash; how can we make the production, consumption and disposal of food within the University  more sustainable?

The University of Edinburgh is currently in the process of drafting its first
[sustainable food policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/course_docs/sustainable_food_policy_sept_2014.pdf).  In this course, your main objective is to work in a small team to develop a project that engages with this policy goal, by designing, building and measuring experimental
innovations.


In order to narrow down the scope of what you do, we ask you focus your project on one of the
following **sub-themes**:

<div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and consumption of food on campus.
    </div>
    <div class="medium-panel">
        Increasing the rate at which students select healthy / sustainable food options, either on campus, or off campus; and with either prepared food or raw ingredients.
    </div>
</div>


Your project work will be divided into five phases over the course of the
semester. Descriptions of the phases can be found by following the links
below:

1. [Preparation]({{ site.baseurl }}/preparation)
2. [Fast Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/fast_hack)
3. [Digging Deeper]({{ site.baseurl }}/digging_deeper)
4. [Slow Hack]({{ site.baseurl }}/slow_hack)
5. [Reporting]({{ site.baseurl }}/reporting)

## Design and Design Methods

The core of a DDS project is closely related to how we think about design.
Here, design is about the processes of identifying and solving problems, often
with input from other people affected by those problems, and often by trial
and error. We adopt the [broad definition of design by Herbert Simon](https://
en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon#The_Sciences_of_the_Artificial.2C_1969), namely 
"devising courses of action aimed at changing existing situations
into preferred ones".

**Design methods** are a form of exploring the world, often via trial and
error: considering options&mdash;even options that sound strange,
uncomfortable or impossible&mdash;and then developing "interventions" as
experiments to see how we can change the current situation. In DDS, we will
use [participatory
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_design); this is a design
process which aims at involving all stakeholders (e.g., students, teaching
staff, catering staff) in defining problems, helping focus on solutions, and
evaluating the effectiveness of interventions.

Design, as a discipline and a collection of processes, has no requirement to
use technology. There is also no requirement to build physical or digital
artifacts. Design may be mostly about ideas, and imagining how something could
potentially work very differently than it does now. Many designs may involve
technology, or make physical objects, but only where this seems appropriate
for the problem at hand.

## Data

Data plays an important role in our approach to design. First, we need to
**understand** "the existing situation", and we use data as an essential tool
to reach this understanding. Second,  in order to **evaluate** the
effectiveness of an intervention, we need to collect data that will helps us measure this.

[What is Data?](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/what_is_data.ipynb) 
gives a quick overview of different kinds of data that we will use in the
course. One important distinction is between subjective and objective
data. Although it's hard to give a completely watertight definition,
subjective data will involve people's thoughts, emotions and values, while
objective data is based on observations of physical phenomena. 

### <a name="two_kinds_of_data"></a>Two kinds of data {#two_kinds_of_data}

As part of your
DDS project, you are required to use both **subjective** and **objective** data. In
addition, you are required to use some **existing** data and also to
**collect** some new data. So your project should involve at least one of the data scenarios shown in these diagrams:

<div class="t30">
    <ul class="small-block-grid-2">
        <li>
            <img class="center" src="{{ site.urlimg }}two_kinds_of_data_1.png" />
        </li>
        <li>
            <img class="center" src="{{ site.urlimg }}two_kinds_of_data_2.png" />
        </li>
    </ul>
