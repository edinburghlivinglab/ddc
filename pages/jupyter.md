## Logging on to JupyterHub

The University is running a multiuser [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) Notebook server as a trial. The framework for this service is called JupyterHub.

To log in to the JupyterHub server, point your browser at <https://jupyter-inf.is.ed.ac.uk>. You will initially be required to authenticate via EASE using your University user name and password. Under the current configuration, you will (probably) get to a page that looks like this:


![Jupyter login page]({{ site.urlimg }}jupyter01.tiff)

We're trying to get a better landing page up &mdash; real soon now. Anyway, select the **My Server** button, and you should get a page like this:

![Jupyter next page]({{ site.urlimg }}jupyter00.tiff)

Now select **dds-notebooks**, and on the following page select **notebooks**. The next page should look like this:

![Notebooks]({{ site.urlimg }}upload.tiff)

Note the **Upload** button at top right corner. This allows you to upload files (e.g. datasets) to your JupyterHub directory.


## A Bit More

The notebook interface is fairly straightforward. But here's a video that might help give more information: [Notebooks and Cells - IPython Notebook Tutorial](https://youtu.be/lmoNmY-cmSI)
