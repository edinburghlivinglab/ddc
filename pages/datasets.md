## Circular Economy-related Datasets

* Edinburgh Council's [Communal Waste Collection Assets](https://data.edinburghopendata.info/dataset/communal-waste-collection-assets)
* Edinburgh Council's [Litter Bins](https://data.edinburghopendata.info/dataset/litter-bins0515v)

## Open Data Portals

The following open data portals may contain datasets that are useful.

* [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/data/search)
* [statistics.gov.scot](http://statistics.gov.scot)
* [Glasgow Open Data Portal](https://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset)
* [Edinburgh Open Data Portal](http://data.edinburghopendata.info/dataset)

In general, it's best to look for datasets using CSV as their format. If you find an interesting dataset that is not in CSV format, let us know and we can try to help convert it.

For example <https://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset/takeaways-and-sandwich-shops-in-glasgow> is based on data from Food Standards Scotland. To get the same info for Edinburgh, we would need to convert [this file](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/OpenDataFiles/FHRS773en-GB.xml) from XML to CSV.
