## Food-related Datasets

* The Open Food Facts project publishes [data for over 60,000 food products](http://openfoodfacts.org) from 134 countries.

* University of Edinburgh [Web Service APIs](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/Services/ILW+Data+Hack+API+Web+Services) [Requires EASE authentication]

* University of Edinburgh Accommodation Services [Cafes and Restaurants](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/data/uoe_catering/UoE_cafes.csv)

* University of Edinburgh [Waste Data by Building](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/tree/master/data/uoe_catering/UoE_Waste_Stats)

* University of Edinburgh [Pollock Halls Student Menus 2015-16](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/data/uoe_catering/JMCC_Student_Menu_2015-2016.csv)

* Nesta's [Food Open Data Challenge](http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/the-open-data-challenge-series/food-open-data-challenge) has provided a document with almost [50 links to food-related datasets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gn10YQ1LKXXpAfBLdUjpbKvF-oKNMbN8Km3S94pU0Ak/edit?pli=1#heading=h.t85l1muj3oih).

## Open Data Portals

The following open data portals may contain datasets that are useful.

* [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/data/search)
* [statistics.gov.scot](http://statistics.gov.scot)
* [Glasgow Open Data Portal](https://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset)
* [Edinburgh Open Data Portal](http://data.edinburghopendata.info/dataset)

In general, it's best to look for datasets using CSV as their format. If you find an interesting dataset that is not in CSV format, let us know and we can try to help convert it.

For example <https://data.glasgow.gov.uk/dataset/takeaways-and-sandwich-shops-in-glasgow> is based on data from Food Standards Scotland. To get the same info for Edinburgh, we would need to convert [this file](http://ratings.food.gov.uk/OpenDataFiles/FHRS773en-GB.xml) from XML to CSV.
