Go to this link: [https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/projects_2016/](https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/projects_2016/) to see examples of presentations given by students of the 2016 Data, Design, and Society course (which this course is modeled on). Students designed projects around the theme of 'food waste and sustainability' at the University of Edinburgh. You can read all about the event, which took place on 23 March 2016, in [Data, Design and Society &mdash; Final Presentions](http://nicolaosborne.blogs.edina.ac.uk/2016/03/23/data-design-society-final-presentations/) by [Nicola Osborne](http://nicolaosborne.blogs.edina.ac.uk/about/).
