## What is data?


1. Start in teams
1. Each person has 5 mins to talk to **two** other people not in their team:
	* What data can you find out about food in Edinburgh from the person you are talking to?
	* You'll need to phrase your question appropriately
	* Record your findings
1. Share results with other members of the team
1. Each team feeds back answer to "What is data?" to whole class

## What is data?

* [My attempt to answer this question](https://github.com/edinburghlivinglab/dds-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/what_is_data.ipynb)

* There is also an interactive version of this IPython Notebook
	* We'll look at this after Fast Hack (or ask me)

# Cat: Data in the field


# Team Tasks 

## Sub-Themes

1. Reducing wastage of food served in Pollock Halls Dining Hall
2. Reducing packaging waste at any point in the production and consumption of food on campus.
3. Increasing the rate at which students select healthy / sustainable food options, either on campus, or off campus; and with either prepared food or raw ingredients.

## Between Now and Friday


1. Pick a sub-theme.
	* If you pick Sub-Theme (3), agree which variant
	* If you pick Sub-Theme (1), also pick a 2nd choice

2. Compare schedules --- what blocks of time can you find together next week?
