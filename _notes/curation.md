Dear DDS Team Reps,
I would really appreciate your help with the following. If you are unable to do it, please delegate to someone else in your team and let me know.

1. Project Summary
Please send me a 1 to 2 page summary of your project which I can put on the DDS website and also send to Alexis Heeren of SRS. Alexis has specifically asked for:

The methodology
The results of any surveys, focus groups or scoping of other Universities
A description of the intervention proposed and any arguments of why this is a good idea and would work at Edinburgh Uni(including examples of where it has worked at other similar institutions)
I'm guessing that for "the methodology", a description of how you engaged with your primary stakeholders would be the main priority.

2. Project Images
Please send me three images of your project that I can put on the DDS website. For an example, see the Team 6 section on the DDS project page.

3. Project Data Archive
Audit all the data you collected: file names, data format, when collected, brief description of contents
Record this information in a 'README' (plaintext) file 
Put the README file and all the data files into your team's folder on DataStore
As long as we can anonymise the data sufficiently, it's probable that some of your  datasets will be made public. I would like you to do this in the coming week, i.e., no later than Thursday 14th April, and let me know when you've done it.
