# Food and Sustainability

# Survey

# Writing (10.00-10.15)

##  Just Writing

* You need an empty writing book just for this course
* It's up to you whether it's lined or unlined.
* This book will be **private**.
* Outcome doesn't matter
* Preparation for 'real' writing


## It's in the doing 

3 mins today!

1. You need a **prompt** -- we'll give you a couple initially.
1. Select prompt, write it as the first thing on the page.
2. Keep your hand moving on the page until time is up. Doesn't need to be fast. Don't stop until time is up! 
2. Stay focussed on the prompt, but if you feel you are getting stuck, try the other prompt.
3. You don't need to write well. You don't need to like what you've written.
4. You're not allowed to show this writing to anyone else.

## Today's Prompts

1. What thoughts and feelings do I have about food?
2. What is sustainability?
