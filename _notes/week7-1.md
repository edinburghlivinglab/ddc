# Feedback on Reports

## What I Learned

<p align="center">
I need to be more explicit about what should be in the report!
</p>

## Context

* It's very helpful to set your theme in a wider context.
* Relate it to the [Essential Reading](https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/reading_list#essential) section of the reading list.
* Although this is not a course where you are expected to do a lot of reading, do refer to a few other references from the [More Depth](https://edinburghlivinglab.github.io/dds/reading_list#more_depth) section to provide more background or motivation to your project.

## Data vs. Interpretation

*What data did you collect for the Fast Hack? What methods did you use to collect it, and how are you dealing with data management?*

* Try to put *all* the relevant information about the data collection in the *Data* section. E.g.:
	* How many respondents were there for each data collection?
	* What categories of people provided data?
	* Where did you collect the data?
	* What questions were on your survey? (If too many, list these in an appendix.)


## Data isn't Neutral

* You will use *categories* in your data collection; e.g. china cups vs. paper cups. 
* What are the assumptions behind your categorisation? Can you justify them?

## Tables, Charts, Photos

* In general, having tables and graphics will make your reports more interesting and thought-provoking.
* But not if the image quality is terrible. Prepare well in advance.

# Communicating Data

Ann never goes to Baristo, but goes to Starbucks 5 times a week. By contrast Bob never goes to Starbucks, but goes to Baristo twice a week. He also goes to Brew Lab 6 times a week, where Ann never goes. He goes to Dome Cafe once a week, while Ann goes there 3 times a week.

Dome Cafe        3       1
Brew Lab         0       6
Starbucks        5       0

> Graphical excellence consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision and efficiency

Graphical excellence gives the viewer:

* the greatest number of ideas
* in the shortest time
* with the least ink
* in the smallest space
