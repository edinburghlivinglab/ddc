# Planning Together

## Issues

* What are the key questions that you will address?
* How robust and complete is the information that you have so far?
* What data do you still need to collect?
* What existing datasets can you use?
* How are you going to test your ideas?

## Tools

* Consider using a collaborative planning tool like [Trello](https://trello.com/)
* Agree on priority tasks
* Set due dates
* Assign tasks to individuals
* Monitor and review progress at regular intervals

# Groupwork

## Listening Again

* Each person in group speaks for 1 minute
    * *How I'm feeling today*
    * *What's the next step for our team*
* Just listen without interrupting
* Good practice for working with Focus Groups next week!

# Data

## JupyterHub &amp; IPython

[https://jupyter-inf.is.ed.ac.uk](https://jupyter-inf.is.ed.ac.uk)

* Experimental service for interactive computing
* Login steps are a bit complicated still; should be simpler soon.
